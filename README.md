# RECommendations Ontology (RECO)

This is a copy of RECO, a vocabulary for recommendations.

## Why are you hosting a copy of this dataset?

We are hosing this vocabulary, since we could not find it anywhere
online anymore.  At the same time, this vocabulary is used in many
Linked Datasets in [YALC](https://github.com/TriplyDB/YALC), so it is
important to have a copy of this vocabulary available.
